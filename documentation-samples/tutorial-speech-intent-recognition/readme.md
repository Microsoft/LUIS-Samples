# Speech to intent 
Read more about speech to intent from the [tutorial](https://aka.ms/luis-intent-recognition-tutorial). 

Before using this code, import the [Human Resources app](../../quickstarts/HumanResources.json). This has intents, entities, and example utterances. 

The key piece of LUIS code is found at ./csharp/LUIS.samples.cs.

Instead of using the Speech subscription key, you need to create the speech factory with the LUIS endpoint key.
